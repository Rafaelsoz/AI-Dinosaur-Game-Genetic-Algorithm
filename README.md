<h2 id="started">üìå About</h2>
In this repository, you will find the construction and optimization of a Neural Network using only the Numpy library for building the architecture and a Genetic Algorithm for optimization. The main goal is to enable Artificial Intelligence to play the T-Rex Game interactively with the environment.

The T-Rex Game is an offline game available in the Google Chrome browser, where a dinosaur must jump over cacti and avoid obstacles to survive as long as possible. Its simplicity makes it excellent for development and testing.

      <h3>Selection</h3>
      <p>Selecting the best individual</p>
      <h3>Cloning and Mutation</h3>
      <p>The best individual is cloned, and then small random mutations are made.</p>
      <h3>Genocide</h3>
      <p>An additional step implemented is Genocide. Since the Genetic Algorithm is sensitive to the initial population, creating a large population increases the search space, allowing convergence points to be found more quickly. However, to demonstrate an iterative process, we work with only 200 agents. If stagnation occurs for 20 epochs, the entire population is randomly reinitialized.</p>
